Pick up data of your choice from the internet and print it on a graphic display.

There are 4 example codes. All of them are clubbed with the **deep sleep** feature of the ESP8266 board. It helps in saving power and prevents over heating during long run.

The data gets updated every 3 hours by default.

Consider using JSON assistant while working on a fresh project: https://arduinojson.org/v6/assistant/

The wiring setup for the example codes which use a display is given below.
